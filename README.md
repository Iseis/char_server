# About
Simple chat client and server. Able to connect multiple servers together to send messages between multiple users across a network of servers. Includes recovery if one server goes down. So the whole network isn't shutdown. Also allows user to create multiple chat rooms, and listen to multiple chat rooms but can only post to one room.
